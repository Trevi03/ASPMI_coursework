## Course Overview

This repository contains coursework for the Adaptive Signal Processing and Machine Intelligence (ASPMI) module. The topics covered include:

- **Latent Component Analysis**  
  Discovering hidden structures in data using various factorization techniques, including:
  - Block-based PCA  
  - Recursive PCA  
  - Applications in spectral estimation

- **Adaptive Filters**  
  Design and implementation of filters that adapt dynamically to non-stationary data environments.

- **Machine Intelligence Algorithms**  
  Exploring nonparametric, data-adaptive machine learning models (e.g., neural networks) that operate without imposing explicit models on the data.

- **Dimensionality Reduction via Tensor Decompositions**  
  Techniques for reducing data dimensionality using tensor factorization.  
  Includes links between:
  - Tensor networks  
  - Deep neural networks
